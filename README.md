# Advent of Code 2021
## https://adventofcode.com/

This seemed like a great opportunity to write a little bit of code every day for a month. A lot of this code isn't pretty, but hopefully by the end of it, I can say I've knocked the rust off.

To whatever extent these help you to solve the problems yourself, great! Or if you want to look and know that you write better code than at least one other person out there, also great!

I will say that if you're stuck and have the urge to peek at a solution, don't unless you're really stuck - more than a day stuck. You can solve it yourself, and you'll feel good that you did it.
